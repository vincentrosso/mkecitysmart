## 3-Year Summary

| | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | **3-Year Total** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Conservative** | $11K | $48K | $144K | **$203K** |

## Revenue Mix Over Time

| Year | Ads % | Subs % | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | ~80% | ~20% | Most users are free, ads dominate |
| Year 2 | ~75% | ~25% | Sub base growing, retention kicks in |
| Year 3 | ~70% | ~30% | Loyal users convert, subs compound |
| Year 4+ | ~60% | ~40% | Subs become the real money as churn stabilizes |

Subscriptions are the long game — they compound because subscribers stay month-over-month. Ad revenue scales linearly with users, but subs build recurring revenue.

## Key Revenue Levers

| Lever | Revenue Impact | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Milwaukee local marketing (Reddit, FB groups, Marquette/UWM, local news) | High | Low cost | Not started |
| ASO — keywords "Milwaukee parking", "parking tickets MKE" | High | Medium | Keywords submitted |
| Referral program ("Give 7 Get 7 days Premium") | Medium | Low | UI already built |
| Parking meter payments (transaction fees $0.25–$0.50/txn) | Very High | High (city API) | Future |
| Multi-city expansion (Madison, Chicago, Minneapolis) | Massive (10x market) | Medium | Architecture ready |
| B2B / City partnerships (data insights) | High | Long sales cycle | Future |
| Parking garage partnerships (affiliate/referral) | Medium | Medium | Future |

## Why iOS and Android Both Matter

- **iOS = money maker** — Higher eCPMs, better subscription conversion rates, higher household income users
- **Android = volume driver** — More downloads, critical for crowdsource data density (need lots of users reporting parking spots for the system to work)
- **Both together** — Android provides the user density that makes the crowdsource engine valuable, which drives iOS users to pay for Pro

## Cost Considerations

| Cost | Monthly | Annual |
|---|---|---|
| Apple Developer Program | $8.33 | $99 |
| Google Play Developer (one-time) | — | $25 |
| Firebase (Spark → Blaze) | $0–$50 | $0–$600 |
| RevenueCat (free up to $2.5K MTR) | $0 | $0 |
| AdMob | Free | Free |
| Domain (mkecitysmart.com) | ~$1.50 | ~$18 |
| Codemagic CI/CD (free tier) | $0 | $0 |
| **Total overhead** | **~$10–$60** | **~$142–$742** |

At even the conservative Year 1 estimate ($11K), you're looking at **95%+ profit margin** since the infrastructure costs are minimal.

## Key Assumptions & Risks

### Assumptions
- Milwaukee is an underserved market for parking apps (no dominant local competitor)
- 3–5% free-to-paid conversion is achievable with proper feature gating
- Crowdsource reports reach critical mass with ~500+ MAU in Milwaukee
- Multi-city expansion reuses 90%+ of existing code

### Risks
- **Low adoption** — Need aggressive local marketing; organic alone won't hit moderate targets
- **Crowdsource cold start** — App needs enough users reporting for data to be useful
- **Subscription fatigue** — Users may resist $4.99/mo for a parking app; may need to test $2.99
- **Competition** — ParkMobile, SpotHero could enter Milwaukee market more aggressively
- **City API dependency** — Some features depend on Milwaukee city data remaining accessible
