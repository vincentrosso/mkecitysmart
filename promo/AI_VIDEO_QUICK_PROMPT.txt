APP ICON: A rounded square with a deep dark green background (#081D19), almost black-green. In the center is a gold metallic location pin (#E0C164) — the classic teardrop map marker shape. Below or inside the pin are bold white capital letters "MKE" in a clean modern sans-serif font. The feel is premium and minimal, like a luxury GPS tool. Dark emerald background + gold pin + white "MKE" text. When animating, the icon glows with a soft gold pulse.

DASHBOARD UI DETAIL: Premium dark theme — deep dark green (#081D19) background. Gold app bar with hamburger menu, "MKE CitySmart" title, and user avatar. Citation risk banner with green checkmark, gold "LOW RISK" badge, "18% probability." Below the risk badge: a live crowdsource parking banner with a pulsing green dot showing "Good — 5 reports nearby • Live" (Free users see availability labels like Good/Limited/Scarce; Pro users see exact spot counts like "~12 spots open"). A small gold report button on the right lets users instantly report they're leaving a spot. Below: 2-column grid of rounded tiles (20px corners), dark forest green (#0D2A26) with thin green borders (#174139). Each tile has a gold icon (36px) on top and bold white title below. Tiles: Alt-side parking, Risk & reminders, Parking heatmap, Report sighting, My tickets, Subscriptions. Bottom nav: 3 tabs (Dashboard/Map/Feed), gold selected state. Welcome message: "Welcome back, Dwayne Sampson!" with waving hand emoji. Overall feel: luxury sports car dashboard meets city navigation. Dark, sleek, gold accents, generous spacing.

PERSON IN VIDEO: Young Black man, mid-to-late 20s, tall (6'0"–6'2"), lean athletic build, deep dark brown/espresso skin tone. Face: oval shape, strong jawline, high cheekbones, small neat chin goatee (no mustache), small subtle face tattoo near left cheekbone. Hair: short black 360 waves with low fade, clean hairline. Tattoos on both hands/wrists (text/script style) and right forearm. Dress him in either (A) black fitted button-down + slim black pants + black shoes (sleek founder look) or (B) dark emerald green suit with black shirt (matches app brand). Lean, confident, stylish — young tech entrepreneur energy. Big genuine smile when smiling, focused/serious when not. Think young Virgil Abloh meets tech startup founder. Milwaukee-made, self-taught, building something bigger than himself. Add a gold watch or chain to match the app's gold accent color.
