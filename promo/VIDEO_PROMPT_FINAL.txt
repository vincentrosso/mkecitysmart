MKE CITYSMART — AI VIDEO CREATOR PROMPT (FINAL)
================================================
Ready to paste into your AI video generator.
Screenshots are in: promo/video_screenshots/

STYLE: Cinematic urban footage, smooth transitions, modern motion graphics.
COLOR PALETTE: Dark green (#081D19), gold (#E0C164), white text.
MUSIC: Upbeat, confident, urban — "city in motion" energy.
VOICE-OVER TONE: Friendly, empowering, community-driven.
FORMAT: 1080x1920 vertical (TikTok/Reels/App Store)


================================================
APP ICON — DETAILED VISUAL DESCRIPTION
================================================
The MKE CitySmart app icon is a rounded square (iOS style with smooth rounded
corners). The background is a rich, deep dark green color (#081D19) — almost
black-green, like a luxury car dashboard at night. 

In the center is a gold/amber location pin icon (#E0C164) — the classic
teardrop map marker shape pointing downward. The pin has a slight metallic
sheen, catching light like brushed gold.

Inside the location pin, or just below it, are the bold capital letters "MKE"
in clean white or cream text (#FDF7EC), using a modern sans-serif font
(similar to Inter or Poppins). The letters are thick, confident, and easy to
read even at small sizes.

The overall feel is premium, minimal, and city-smart — like a luxury navigation
tool. Dark green conveys trust and urban sophistication. The gold pin conveys
location awareness and value. Think of it as: "a gold GPS pin on a dark
emerald background with MKE written on it."

For video purposes: When animating the icon, have it glow with a soft gold
pulse radiating outward from the pin, as if it's actively tracking and
protecting the user's parking location.


================================================
DASHBOARD & APP UI — DETAILED VISUAL DESCRIPTION
================================================
OVERALL THEME:
The entire app uses a premium dark theme. The main background is a very deep
dark green (#081D19) — almost black with a green undertone, like looking into
a deep forest at night. It feels luxurious and modern, not just "dark mode."

APP BAR:
- Top left: Hamburger menu icon (3 horizontal lines) in gold (#E0C164)
- Center-left: App title "MKE CitySmart" in gold text, bold, modern sans-serif
- Top right: User avatar circle (gold with initial letter "D") followed by
  username "Dwayne" with a dropdown arrow, all in gold

CITATION RISK BANNER (below app bar):
- Full-width card with dark green background and a thin gold/green border
- Left side: Green circle with white checkmark icon
- Center: Gold badge pill reading "LOW RISK" followed by white text
  "18% citation probability"
- Below: Muted gray text "Your current location • Based on 466K+ citations"
- The banner has a subtle gradient glow effect

DASHBOARD TILES (main content):
- Layout: 2-column grid, evenly spaced with 16px gaps
- Each tile is a rounded rectangle (20px border radius)
- Tile background: Dark forest green (#0D2A26) with a slightly lighter
  green border (#174139), 1px thin border
- Tile padding: 16px horizontal, 14px vertical
- Each tile contains:
  - TOP: A gold/amber icon (#F8C660), 36px size, using Material Design icons
    (e.g., arrows for Alt-side, bell for Risk, map for Heatmap, warning
    triangle for Report)
  - BOTTOM: White title text, 16px bold (e.g., "Alt-side parking",
    "Risk & reminders", "Parking heatmap", "Report sighting")
  - Some tiles have a muted gray subtitle below (e.g., "Odd/Even side",
    "Plans & perks")
- Tiles visible in the dashboard screenshot:
  Row 1: Alt-side parking | Risk & reminders
  Row 2: Parking heatmap | Report sighting
  Row 3: My tickets | Subscriptions (partially visible)

BOTTOM NAVIGATION BAR:
- Background: Same deep dark green (#081D19)
- 3 tabs with icons above labels:
  - "Dashboard" (grid icon) — selected state: gold icon + gold text
  - "Map" (map/book icon) — unselected: muted gray-green (#9BA59C)
  - "Feed" (list icon) — unselected: muted gray-green
- Selected tab has gold (#E0C164) icon and text
- Clean divider line above the nav bar

WELCOME MESSAGE (above bottom nav):
- Small waving hand emoji 👋 followed by gold text
  "Welcome back, Dwayne Sampson!" in italics
- Feels personal and warm

BUTTONS THROUGHOUT APP:
- Primary buttons: Gold/amber (#E0C164) background with dark green text
- Rounded corners (12px radius), full width, 52px height
- Text is bold, centered, 16px

OVERALL FEEL:
Think premium sports car dashboard meets city navigation app. Dark, sleek,
gold accents everywhere. Clean typography, generous spacing, no clutter.
Every element breathes. The gold on dark green color combo feels like money,
trust, and sophistication.
