MKE CITYSMART — AI VIDEO CREATOR PROMPT (FINAL)
================================================
Ready to paste into your AI video generator.
Screenshots are in: promo/video_screenshots/

STYLE: Cinematic urban footage, smooth transitions, modern motion graphics.
COLOR PALETTE: Dark green (#081D19), gold (#E0C164), white text.
MUSIC: Upbeat, confident, urban — "city in motion" energy.
VOICE-OVER TONE: Friendly, empowering, community-driven.
FORMAT: 1080x1920 vertical (TikTok/Reels/App Store)


================================================
APP ICON — DETAILED VISUAL DESCRIPTION
================================================
The MKE CitySmart app icon is a rounded square (iOS style with smooth rounded
corners). The background is a rich, deep dark green color (#081D19) — almost
black-green, like a luxury car dashboard at night. 

In the center is a gold/amber location pin icon (#E0C164) — the classic
teardrop map marker shape pointing downward. The pin has a slight metallic
sheen, catching light like brushed gold.

Inside the location pin, or just below it, are the bold capital letters "MKE"
in clean white or cream text (#FDF7EC), using a modern sans-serif font
(similar to Inter or Poppins). The letters are thick, confident, and easy to
read even at small sizes.

The overall feel is premium, minimal, and city-smart — like a luxury navigation
tool. Dark green conveys trust and urban sophistication. The gold pin conveys
location awareness and value. Think of it as: "a gold GPS pin on a dark
emerald background with MKE written on it."

For video purposes: When animating the icon, have it glow with a soft gold
pulse radiating outward from the pin, as if it's actively tracking and
protecting the user's parking location.


================================================
DASHBOARD & APP UI — DETAILED VISUAL DESCRIPTION
================================================
OVERALL THEME:
The entire app uses a premium dark theme. The main background is a very deep
dark green (#081D19) — almost black with a green undertone, like looking into
a deep forest at night. It feels luxurious and modern, not just "dark mode."

APP BAR:
- Top left: Hamburger menu icon (3 horizontal lines) in gold (#E0C164)
- Center-left: App title "MKE CitySmart" in gold text, bold, modern sans-serif
- Top right: User avatar circle (gold with initial letter "D") followed by
  username "Dwayne" with a dropdown arrow, all in gold

CITATION RISK BANNER (below app bar):
- Full-width card with dark green background and a thin gold/green border
- Left side: Green circle with white checkmark icon
- Center: Gold badge pill reading "LOW RISK" followed by white text
  "18% citation probability"
- Below: Muted gray text "Your current location • Based on 466K+ citations"
- The banner has a subtle gradient glow effect

DASHBOARD TILES (main content):
- Layout: 2-column grid, evenly spaced with 16px gaps
- Each tile is a rounded rectangle (20px border radius)
- Tile background: Dark forest green (#0D2A26) with a slightly lighter
  green border (#174139), 1px thin border
- Tile padding: 16px horizontal, 14px vertical
- Each tile contains:
  - TOP: A gold/amber icon (#F8C660), 36px size, using Material Design icons
    (e.g., arrows for Alt-side, bell for Risk, map for Heatmap, warning
    triangle for Report)
  - BOTTOM: White title text, 16px bold (e.g., "Alt-side parking",
    "Risk & reminders", "Parking heatmap", "Report sighting")
  - Some tiles have a muted gray subtitle below (e.g., "Odd/Even side",
    "Plans & perks")
- Tiles visible in the dashboard screenshot:
  Row 1: Alt-side parking | Risk & reminders
  Row 2: Parking heatmap | Report sighting
  Row 3: My tickets | Subscriptions (partially visible)

LIVE PARKING BANNER (between risk badge and tiles):
- A compact card with dark green (#0C241F) background and thin colored border
- Left side: Pulsing colored dot (green = good, orange = limited, red = scarce)
- Center: Availability text — Free users see labels like "Good" or "Limited";
  Pro users see exact counts like "~12 spots open"
- Below: Muted gray text "5 reports nearby • Live" showing real-time data
- Right side: Small gold report button (📍 icon) — tapping it opens a bottom
  sheet where users can report: Open Spot, Full Area, Enforcement Spotted, etc.
- If no reports nearby yet: Shows "Be the first to report!" with a tap CTA
- The banner auto-updates via Firestore stream — truly live, always current
- This is the heart of the community feature: neighbors helping neighbors
  find parking in real time

BOTTOM NAVIGATION BAR:
- Background: Same deep dark green (#081D19)
- 3 tabs with icons above labels:
  - "Dashboard" (grid icon) — selected state: gold icon + gold text
  - "Map" (map/book icon) — unselected: muted gray-green (#9BA59C)
  - "Feed" (list icon) — unselected: muted gray-green
- Selected tab has gold (#E0C164) icon and text
- Clean divider line above the nav bar

WELCOME MESSAGE (above bottom nav):
- Small waving hand emoji 👋 followed by gold text
  "Welcome back, Dwayne Sampson!" in italics
- Feels personal and warm

BUTTONS THROUGHOUT APP:
- Primary buttons: Gold/amber (#E0C164) background with dark green text
- Rounded corners (12px radius), full width, 52px height
- Text is bold, centered, 16px

OVERALL FEEL:
Think premium sports car dashboard meets city navigation app. Dark, sleek,
gold accents everywhere. Clean typography, generous spacing, no clutter.
Every element breathes. The gold on dark green color combo feels like money,
trust, and sophistication.


================================================
PERSON IN VIDEO — CHARACTER DESCRIPTION
================================================
The person appearing in the video (walking to car, holding phone, checking
the app) should match this description EXACTLY:

NAME: Dwayne Sampson (the app's creator)

ETHNICITY & SKIN TONE:
- Black man, deep rich dark brown/espresso skin tone — very dark complexion,
  even-toned, smooth. Think Djimon Hounsou or Kofi Siriboe range.

BUILD & HEIGHT:
- Tall (approximately 6'0"–6'2"), lean and athletic build
- Not bulky — slim/toned frame with visible muscle definition in the arms
  and shoulders (seen clearly in the work photo with hi-vis vest)
- Long limbs, proportional, model-type physique
- Carries himself with confidence — upright posture, chest slightly forward

FACE:
- Oval/long face shape with strong defined jawline
- High cheekbones, prominent but not overly so
- Clean-shaven face with a small, neat goatee/chin beard (just on the chin,
  no mustache connecting — a "chin strap" style goatee, closely trimmed)
- Full lips, straight nose bridge
- Dark brown eyes, expressive
- Small tattoo on the left cheek/face area (near the cheekbone) — subtle,
  like a small symbol or text
- Overall expression: confident but approachable, magnetic smile when smiling
  (big genuine smile with white teeth), serious/focused when not smiling

HAIR:
- Short black hair with neat wave pattern (360 waves) — closely cropped on
  the sides with a low fade, slightly longer on top to show the wave pattern
- Clean hairline, well-groomed — barbershop fresh
- Sometimes wears a fitted cap (snapback style) — red with green underbrim

TATTOOS:
- Small face tattoo near left cheekbone (subtle)
- Tattoos on both hands/wrists — visible ink on the top of the hands and
  inner wrist area (appears to be text/script style)
- Tattoos on the right forearm/arm area (visible in the work photo)
- The tattoos are not full-sleeve — they're selective placements,
  mostly on hands, wrists, and forearms

FOR THE VIDEO — WARDROBE:
- For the PROMO VIDEO, dress him in a smart-casual/elevated street style:
  Option A (preferred): Black fitted button-down shirt, slim black pants,
  clean black shoes — sleek, minimal, founder-CEO look
  Option B: Dark green or emerald suit (matches the app's brand color) with
  a black shirt underneath — polished, premium tech-entrepreneur look
- NO hi-vis vest, no work boots — this is the polished founder version
- Clean fitted clothing that shows his lean athletic build
- Could add a gold watch or gold chain to tie into the app's gold accent color

VIBE & ENERGY:
- Young Black tech entrepreneur, mid-to-late 20s
- Confident, driven, stylish — someone who looks like they built something
  and are proud of it
- Milwaukee native energy — real, relatable, not corporate/stuffy
- When walking to his car: purposeful stride, phone in hand
- When looking at the app: focused, slight smile of satisfaction
- When looking at camera (closing scene): direct eye contact, confident
  knowing nod, slight smile — "I built this for us"

REFERENCE MOOD: Think young Virgil Abloh meets tech startup founder.
Milwaukee-made, self-taught, stylish, and building something bigger than
himself.

updates with a brief pulse animation. Cut to another phone nearby — their
banner now shows "~1 spot open" with an orange glow. Warm, community feel.
