- 2026-01-14 [F-003] App-to-backend connectivity confirmed via iOS simulator submission; sightings write succeeded with mirroring; test doc "Dwayne Jan 14th Test Feed" at Dretzka Park, expires ~8 PM (temp open rules used).
- 2026-01-14 [F-002] Inventory Cloud Functions (prod) - clean deploy confirmed with logs.
  Status: DONE
  Goal: Full visibility into deployed functions in production (project: mkeparkapp-1ad15), with confirmation of clean deploys, consistent configs (region: us-central1, runtime: nodejs20, memory: 256MiB), and no errors in audit/runtime logs. This answers "What backend actually exists right now?" and verifies stability for the P0 chain.
  Inventory Summary: 6 deployed 2nd gen Cloud Functions (via gcloud functions describe --gen2):
    - cleanupExpiredSightings (Scheduled trigger; expiration system)
    - helloWorld (HTTPS trigger; test endpoint)
    - mirrorSightingsToAlerts (Firestore write on sightings/{sightingId})
    - mirrorUserSightingsToGlobal (Firestore create on users/{uid}/sightings/{sightingId})
    - notifyOnApproval (Firestore update on alerts/{alertId})
    - submitSighting (Callable HTTPS trigger; core submission endpoint)
  Config Checks: All functions consistent (us-central1, nodejs20, 256MiB); triggers align with app needs (submission, mirroring for feeds/alerts, scheduled cleanup).
  Log Verification: Deployment audits successful (e.g., 2026-01-14T18:52:19Z for submitSighting); runtime errors none (severity>=ERROR empty); cleanupExpiredSightings runs ~every 5 min (HTTP 200 OK, ~0.1–1.0s latency); submitSighting has no invocations yet.
  Commands Used: gcloud functions describe --gen2; gcloud logging read (resource.type=cloud_run_revision, service_name, severity>=ERROR).
  Recommendations: Add targeted console.log statements (e.g., "Expired X sightings") for faster debugging; backend appears stable.
- 2026-01-11 [F-005] Verified sightings can be created and persist in Firestore; manual docs showed feed invisibility comes from path/schema mismatch; data layer is sound when written to correct collections.
- 2026-01-10 [F-001] Confirmed MKE City Smart is using the correct Firebase project (Blaze plan). Ruled out environment mismatch as cause of missing alerts/sightings. Removed “wrong project” as a failure vector in backend debugging.
- 2026-01-11 [F-004] Defined and validated the production Firestore schema. Locked core collections (sightings, live_sightings, alerts) and required fields. Confirmed that writing to incorrect paths explains “missing” feed data. Schema is now the single source of truth for app + backend.
- 2026-01-14 [F-401] Updated alerts rules for public reads + admin deletes; added firestore.indexes.json reference; deployed rules + indexes.

- Flutter version: uses Flutter 3.29.x locally; run `flutter --version` if needed.
- Platforms: iOS, Android, Web; web uses `web/firebase-config.json` and Dart config in `lib/firebase_options.dart`.
- Firebase: Config in `lib/firebase_options.dart` (web/android/ios). Web also has `web/firebase-config.json`. Register authorized domains for web in Firebase Auth.
- Auth flows:
  * Email/password: handled in `lib/screens/auth_screen.dart` via `UserProvider.register/login`.
  * Phone, Google, Apple: see `UserProvider` methods and `_handlePhoneSignUp`, `_handleGoogle`, `_handleApple` in auth screen.
  * Guest mode supported.
- Profile:
  * Profile page (`lib/screens/profile_screen.dart`) now geocodes addresses via `geocoding` and saves raw + formatted address + lat/lng in `UserProfile`.
  * `UserProfile` JSON fields: `formattedAddress`, `addressLatitude`, `addressLongitude` added.
- Linting:
  * `flutter analyze` currently clean. Deprecated `withOpacity`, `describeEnum`, and `desiredAccuracy` already replaced.
  * Welcome dialog and quick-start tutorial are disabled via flags in `lib/main.dart`. Promo banner on dashboard is commented out.
- CI sanity check:
  * Run `flutter analyze` after changes (fast lint/error pass; no device/emulator required).
- Web embeds:
  * `openchargemap_embed_web.dart` and `publicstuff_embed_web.dart` use `package:web` instead of `dart:html`. Dependency `web` is added to pubspec.
- Scripts:
  * `scripts/test_firebase_auth.py` to hit Firebase Identity Toolkit REST (sign-up/sign-in). Reads web API key from env `FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY` or falls back to `lib/firebase_options.dart` web key.
- Pods / iOS:
  * CocoaPods repo updated and pods installed with Firebase iOS SDK 12.4.0. Warning about base configuration is benign with custom xcconfigs.
- Feature toggles:
  * Welcome dialog: `CitySmartShell._welcomeDialogEnabled` (currently false).
  * Quick start tutorial: `_quickStartEnabled` false; helper widgets removed.
  * Promo banner disabled in `lib/screens/dashboard_screen.dart`.
- Addressing:
  * When updating profile address, failures in geocoding block the save with a snackbar.
- Debugging:
  * VS Code launch config in `.vscode/launch.json` includes Flutter web (Chrome).
- Navigation chrome:
  * Shared `CitySmartScaffold` (drawer + CitySmart title + bottom nav) in `lib/widgets/citysmart_scaffold.dart`.
  * Applied to landing, dashboard, feed, profile, auth, vehicles, and charging map screens; bottom nav routes to `/dashboard`, `/citysmart-map`, `/citysmart-feed`.
- Branding:
  * User-facing brand text updated to “MKE CitySmart” across app bars, welcome, splash, and auth copy.
  * iOS/macOS app icons updated from `assets/MKE_AppIcon.appiconset.zip` into:
    - `ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`
    - `macos/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` (currently uses the same set; replace with macOS-specific sizes if provided).
  * Web manifest renamed to "MKE CitySmart" with updated icons (`web/icons/Icon-192.png`, `Icon-512.png`, maskable variants) and favicon regenerated from the 1024px master.

Open items / reminders:
- If re-enabling welcome or quick-start, restore content in `main.dart`.
- If you rotate Firebase keys, update both `lib/firebase_options.dart` and `web/firebase-config.json`.
- For web iframe embeds, ensure `web` dependency stays in sync and authorized domains are set.
- After any code changes, run `flutter analyze` to ensure code quality.
- The project should maintain at least 80% unit test coverage.

App layout (current)
- Shell: `CitySmartScaffold` (drawer + title + bottom nav + user profile) wraps all main screens.
- Routes: `/dashboard` (default home), `/citysmart-feed`, `/citysmart-map`, `/profile`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/vehicles`, `/charging-map`, `/parking-heatmap`, `/parking-finder`, `/ticket-tracker`, `/onboarding`, `/saved-places`, `/tow-helper`.

Coverage and size snapshot (after latest tests)
- Overall: 26.44% (1703/6440 lines) from `coverage/lcov.info`.
- Coverage by segment: screens 4.6% (128/2813), services 75.2% (574/763), widgets 16.7% (26/156), models 84.1% (391/465), providers 25.6% (188/733), data 26.7% (356/1331), citysmart 15.3% (13/85).
- LOC by segment (Dart): screens 7,739; services 2,000; widgets 525; models 1,142; providers 1,836; data 3,079; citysmart 611.

Architecture flow (text diagram)
- UI (screens/widgets) ⇄ Providers (ChangeNotifier, e.g., UserProvider)
    Providers depend on UserRepository + services for async work and local hydration.
- UserRepository
    ⇄ Firebase Auth (session)
    ⇄ Firestore (users + subcollections)
    ⇄ Drift Local DB (profiles, vehicles, pending mutations)
    → Outbox sync: enqueue on Firestore failure → syncPending retries when online.
- Services
    - ApiClient (POST with env base URL/API key) → Prediction/Notification/token registration.
    - RiskAlertService (timer, tow/ticket scoring) → LocationService + CityTicketStatsService + TicketRiskPredictionService → NotificationService (local/FCM).
    - NotificationService (FCM/local) guarded for web/disabled flag.
    - StreetSegmentService (ArcGIS), TicketApiService (mock), PredictionApiService (HTTP).
    - LocationService (Geolocator, sample zones, distance/directions).
- Firebase bootstrap
    - firebase_bootstrap + firebase_options (platform configs), web also uses web/firebase-config.json.

Future Enhancements (to implement if users request)
---------------------------------------
- Multi-State Expansion (LONG-TERM ROADMAP):
  * Current state: App supports multi-city data collection via MunicipalityService
  * All citation/sighting data is tagged with municipalityId, city, state
  * Wisconsin cities are currently the focus with _knownWisconsinCities list
  * Phase 1 (Current): Wisconsin cities - Milwaukee metro focus, data collection from any WI city
  * Phase 2 (Future): Midwest expansion - Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa
  * Phase 3 (Long-term): National expansion - Major metro areas across US
  * Technical foundation already in place:
    - MunicipalityService detects city/state from GPS coordinates
    - citation_analytics organized by municipalityId
    - municipality_stats tracks data per city
    - sighting_stats tracks sightings per city
  * When expanding to new state:
    1. Add state's cities to known cities list
    2. Source city parking rules/regulations
    3. Build city-specific rule packs (like CityRulePack)
    4. Partner with local users for beta testing
    5. Launch when sufficient data collected (500+ citations for predictions)
  * Monetization scales with cities - each new metro is a new market

- Full App Localization (i18n):
  * Current state: Language setting in City Settings changes the app locale for date/time formats and
    Material widget text (calendar, date pickers, dialog buttons), but custom app UI text (like "Save",
    "Settings", "Dashboard") remains hardcoded in English.
  * To implement full translations: Use Flutter's localization system with ARB files.
    - Add `flutter_localizations` to pubspec.yaml (already done)
    - Create `lib/l10n/` folder with ARB files: `app_en.arb`, `app_es.arb`, `app_ar.arb`, etc.
    - Add `generate: true` to pubspec.yaml flutter section
    - Create `l10n.yaml` config file
    - Replace hardcoded strings with `AppLocalizations.of(context)!.stringKey`
    - Supported languages: English (en), Spanish (es), Arabic (ar), French (fr), Chinese (zh), Hindi (hi), Greek (el)
  * Hmong (hmn) not supported by Flutter's Material localizations - would need custom delegate.
  * Estimated effort: ~2-3 days for full implementation depending on string count.

- Custom Email Domain Setup (PENDING - 2026-02-05):
  * Domain: mkecitysmart.com
  * Purpose: Send Firebase Auth emails (verification, password reset) from noreply@mkecitysmart.com instead of noreply@mkeparkapp-1ad15.firebaseapp.com
  * DNS Records Configured (verified via dig):
    - TXT "firebase=mkeparkapp-1ad15" (Firebase verification)
    - TXT "v=spf1 include:_spf.firebaseemail.com ~all" (SPF for Firebase email)
    - CNAME firebase1._domainkey.mkecitysmart.com → mail-mkecitysmart-com.dkim1.firebasemail.com (DKIM)
    - CNAME firebase2._domainkey.mkecitysmart.com → mail-mkecitysmart-com.dkim2.firebasemail.com (DKIM)
  * Status: DNS records propagated correctly, waiting for Firebase Console to verify domain
  * Next Steps:
    1. Check Firebase Console → Authentication → Templates → Email domain verification status
    2. Once verified, update email templates with custom sender (noreply@mkecitysmart.com)
    3. Customize email template text/branding to match MKE CitySmart
  * APNs Key for Phone Auth: AuthKey_937GPQ4M9B.p8 (uploaded to Firebase Console)

- Welcome Dialog Prompt (FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION - 2026-02-05):
  * Show after successful registration/first sign-in
  * Design: Celebratory, community-focused, brand-aligned
  * Copy:
    ───────────────────────────────────────
