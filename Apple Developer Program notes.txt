- Apple Developer Program account under team J8U8FW3PA8 with access to App Store Connect for the app. Make sure the App ID is already created (bundle id matches the Flutter app).

- iOS Distribution certificate (.p12) exported from Keychain (or a codemagic_code_sign.p12 as
mentioned in README.md:93-100). Keep the certificate password handy; Fastlane uses it when importing the key. Install the certificate locally (double-click or security import) so Xcode/Fastlane can use it.

- “App Store” provisioning profile (.mobileprovision) generated from the developer portal for that bundle ID, using the above distribution cert, and downloaded locally. Place it somewhere like .secrets/apple/J8U8FW3PA8_20251204.mobileprovision and either double-click to install or
let Fastlane match handle it. The profile must include the exact bundle id and any required entitlements.

- App Store Connect authentication: choose either
  1. App Store Connect API key (AuthKey_XXXXXX.p8 + key ID + issuer ID). Fastlane
     uses this when APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_PATH, APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID, and
     APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID are set, or
  2. Apple ID/password with an app-specific password
     (FASTLANE_APPLE_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD). You’d also set APPLE_ID, TEAM_ID, and
     optionally ITC_TEAM_ID.
